 - [x] ***is a programming paradigm a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.***

 

 

 - [x] ***it is a declarative programming paradigm in which function
       definitions are trees of expressions that each return a value,
       rather than a sequence of imperative statements which change the
       state of the program.***

  

 - [x] ***functional programming solves the problem of how to write code that is easy to read and easy to maintain.***


## Java Functional Interfaces
An Interface that contains exactly one abstract method is known as functional interface some times we add @FunctionalInterface. It can have any number of default, static methods but can contain only one abstract method. It can also declare methods of object class.

Functional Interface is also known as Single Abstract Method Interfaces or SAM Interfaces. It is a new feature in Java, which helps to achieve functional programming approach.

## Basic Concept
The basic concept behind streams is simple: We got a data source, perform zero or more intermediate operations, and get a result.

***functional programming operations in general are not thread safe which means that they are not safe to use in a multi-threaded environment.***

> **functional programming** : uses operations that are not part of the Java language, such as map, filter, and reduce.
 Streams in Java provide a functional approach to process a collection of objects.
